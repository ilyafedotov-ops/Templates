- Use provisioned concurrency
- Optimize package size
- Implement keep-warm strategies

**Timeout Errors:**
- Review function timeout settings
- Check external service latencies
- Implement async patterns
- Use step functions for long-running tasks

**Cost Overruns:**
- Review execution frequency
- Optimize memory allocation
- Check for infinite loops
- Implement request throttling

    az apim api import \
      --specification-format OpenApi \
      --specification-path api-spec.yaml \
      --path /api \
      --api-id serverless-api
```

### Event-Driven Architecture
```yaml
