## Critical Configuration Issues (Risk Score 9.0-10.0)

### CRIT-001: Public Storage Account Access
**Risk Score:** 9.8 (Critical)  
**CIS Control:** 3.3 - Ensure storage account access keys are periodically regenerated  
**MCSB ID:** DP-2 - Protect sensitive data  
**Affected Resources:** [X] storage accounts across [X] subscriptions

**Description:**
Multiple storage accounts are configured to allow public blob access, exposing sensitive data including customer information, application secrets, and backup files to the internet without authentication.

**Affected Storage Accounts:**
```powershell
# PowerShell query used for discovery
Get-AzStorageAccount | Where-Object {$_.AllowBlobPublicAccess -eq $true} | 
    Select-Object StorageAccountName, ResourceGroupName, AllowBlobPublicAccess
```

**Evidence:**
- **stproddata001:** Contains customer PII files accessible via public URLs
- **stbackups002:** Database backups publicly readable
- **stlogs003:** Application logs with embedded API keys exposed

**Business Impact:**
- **Data Breach Risk:** 2.3M customer records exposed to unauthorized access
- **Compliance Violations:** GDPR Article 32, PCI-DSS Requirement 3
- **Intellectual Property Theft:** Proprietary algorithms and business logic exposed
- **Financial Liability:** Potential fines up to 4% of annual revenue

**Proof of Exposure:**
```bash
# Anonymous access test
curl -s "https://stproddata001.blob.core.windows.net/customers/customer_data.csv" | head -n 5
# Returns actual customer data without authentication
```

**Immediate Remediation (0-24 hours):**
```powershell
# Disable public access immediately
$storageAccounts = @("stproddata001", "stbackups002", "stlogs003")
foreach ($account in $storageAccounts) {
    Set-AzStorageAccount -ResourceGroupName "rg-storage" -Name $account -AllowBlobPublicAccess $false
}
```

**Long-term Solution:**
1. Implement Azure Policy to prevent public storage account creation
2. Deploy Azure Private Endpoints for storage access
3. Implement storage account network restrictions
4. Enable storage account logging and monitoring

### CRIT-002: Overprivileged Service Principals

**MCSB ID:** PA-7 - Follow just enough administration (least privilege)  
**Affected Resources:** [X] service principals with excessive permissions

**Description:**
Service principals have been granted excessive permissions including Global Administrator, Subscription Owner, and Contributor roles without justification or time limitations, violating the principle of least privilege.

**High-Risk Service Principals:**
| Service Principal | Permissions | Risk Level | Justification |
|------------------|-------------|------------|---------------|
| sp-automation-001 | Global Admin | Critical | None documented |
| sp-backup-service | Owner (5 subscriptions) | Critical | Excessive scope |
| sp-monitoring-001 | Contributor | High | Over-permissioned |
| sp-legacy-app | User Admin | High | Deprecated app |

**Evidence Collection:**
```powershell
# Query service principals with high privileges
$roles = @("Global Administrator", "Owner", "Contributor", "User Administrator")
foreach ($role in $roles) {
    Get-AzRoleAssignment | Where-Object {$_.RoleDefinitionName -eq $role -and $_.ObjectType -eq "ServicePrincipal"}
}
```

**Attack Scenarios:**
1. **Service Principal Credential Compromise:** If credentials are leaked, attacker gains administrative access
2. **Supply Chain Attack:** Malicious code in applications could abuse elevated permissions
3. **Insider Threat:** Developers with service principal access could abuse permissions
4. **Automated Attack:** Compromised automation scripts could perform malicious actions

**Immediate Actions:**
1. Audit all service principal permissions within 48 hours
2. Remove unnecessary high-privilege role assignments
3. Implement time-bound access for administrative roles
4. Enable audit logging for service principal activities

### CRIT-003: Network Security Group Misconfigurations
**Risk Score:** 8.9 (Critical)  
**CIS Control:** 4.1 - Ensure that 'SSH access is restricted from the internet'  
**MCSB ID:** NS-1 - Implement network segmentation  
**Affected Resources:** [X] NSGs with overly permissive rules

**Description:**
Network Security Groups contain rules allowing unrestricted internet access to management protocols (RDP, SSH) and database ports, creating direct attack vectors for threat actors.

**High-Risk NSG Rules:**
| NSG Name | Rule Name | Protocol | Source | Destination | Port | Action |
|----------|-----------|----------|--------|-------------|------|--------|
| nsg-web-prod | allow-rdp-any | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Any | 3389 | Allow |
| nsg-db-tier | allow-sql-internet | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Any | 1433 | Allow |
| nsg-app-servers | allow-ssh-any | TCP | 0.0.0.0/0 | Any | 22 | Allow |
| nsg-mgmt | allow-all-protocols | Any | 0.0.0.0/0 | Any | Any | Allow |

**Vulnerability Assessment:**
```bash
# Scan for open ports from internet
nmap -sS -O -p1-65535 [public-ip-range]

# Results show exposed services:
# Port 22/tcp (SSH) - Multiple servers
# Port 3389/tcp (RDP) - Windows servers
# Port 1433/tcp (SQL Server) - Database servers
```

**Business Impact:**
- **Direct Server Compromise:** Internet-exposed management interfaces
