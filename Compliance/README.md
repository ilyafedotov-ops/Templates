## Multi-Framework Mapping Methodologies

### Crosswalk Development Process

#### 1. Control Identification and Categorization
```
Process Flow:
Framework A Control → Common Control Objective → Framework B Control
     ↓                         ↓                        ↓
Analysis of intent → Identify shared requirements → Map equivalent controls
```

#### 2. Mapping Methodologies

**Direct Mapping**: One-to-one control relationships
- Example: ISO 27001 A.9.1.1 (Access Control Policy) ↔ SOC 2 CC6.1 (Access Controls)

**Partial Mapping**: One-to-many or many-to-one relationships
- Example: ISO 27001 A.12.6.1 (Management of Technical Vulnerabilities) maps to multiple SOC 2 controls

**Gap Identification**: Controls unique to specific frameworks
- Document additional requirements and implementation needs

#### 3. Azure Service Mapping
Each control maps to specific Azure services and configurations:

```yaml
Control_Mapping:
  ISO_27001_A_9_4_2:  # Secure log-on procedures
    Azure_Services:
      - Azure Active Directory
      - Conditional Access
      - Multi-Factor Authentication
    Implementation:
      - Policy: "require-mfa-policy.json"
      - Configuration: "conditional-access-config.yml"
    Evidence_Points:
      - Sign-in logs
      - Policy assignments
      - Risk detections
```
