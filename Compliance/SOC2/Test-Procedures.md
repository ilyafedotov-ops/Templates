## Testing Methodology and Framework

### 1.1 Testing Philosophy and Approach

#### Design Effectiveness Testing
- **Objective**: Evaluate whether controls are suitably designed to achieve specified control objectives
- **Timing**: As of the end of the reporting period
- **Focus**: Control design documentation, policies, procedures, and system configurations
- **Standards**: Must meet AICPA AT-C 105 requirements for design effectiveness

#### Operating Effectiveness Testing
- **Objective**: Evaluate whether controls operated effectively throughout the reporting period
- **Timing**: Throughout the entire reporting period (minimum 6 months for Type II)
- **Focus**: Evidence of control operation, including exception identification and analysis
- **Standards**: Must meet AICPA AT-C 215 requirements for operating effectiveness

### 1.2 Testing Approach Selection Matrix

| Control Type | Design Testing | Operating Testing | Rationale |
|--------------|----------------|-------------------|-----------|
| Automated | Configuration review | Exception analysis + Sample testing | Automated controls typically operate consistently |
| Manual | Policy review + Walkthrough | Statistical sampling | Manual controls require broader testing |
| IT Dependent Manual | Both automated and manual approaches | Combined testing approach | Dual reliance requires comprehensive testing |
| Entity-Level | Management interview + Documentation | Observation + Inquiry | Pervasive controls require different evidence types |

### 1.3 Risk-Based Testing Framework

#### Control Risk Assessment
1. **Inherent Risk Factors**
   - Complexity of the control
   - Degree of automation
   - Competence of personnel
   - Management oversight
   - Change frequency

2. **Control Design Quality**
   - Precision of control design
   - Adequacy of control documentation
   - Logical flow of control procedures
   - Integration with system processes

3. **Historical Performance**
   - Prior period exceptions
   - Management remediation effectiveness
   - Control environment changes
   - System modifications impact

#### Testing Intensity Matrix

| Risk Level | Design Testing Intensity | Operating Testing Intensity | Sample Size Multiplier |
|------------|-------------------------|---------------------------|----------------------|
| High | Extensive documentation review + Management inquiry + System walkthrough | Large sample size + Exception analysis + Supplemental procedures | 2.0x |
| Medium | Standard documentation review + Walkthrough | Standard sample size + Exception analysis | 1.0x |
| Low | Documentation review + Inquiry | Reduced sample size + Exception analysis | 0.5x |

## Sample Selection Methodologies

### 2.1 Statistical Sampling Framework

#### 2.1.1 Attributes Sampling
**Application**: Testing controls with binary outcomes (performed/not performed)

**Sample Size Calculation**:
```
n = (Z² × p × (1-p)) / E²
Where:
- n = sample size
- Z = confidence level (1.96 for 95%, 2.58 for 99%)
- p = expected deviation rate
- E = tolerable deviation rate
```

**Standard Parameters**:
- Confidence Level: 95% (99% for high-risk controls)
- Expected Deviation Rate: 2-5% (based on prior year results)
- Tolerable Deviation Rate: 5-10% (based on control criticality)

#### 2.1.2 Variables Sampling
**Application**: Testing controls with quantitative outcomes (amounts, frequencies)

**Methods**:
- **Mean-per-Unit (MPU)**: Direct estimation of population total
- **Ratio Estimation**: When book values are available
- **Difference Estimation**: When audit values are compared to book values

#### 2.1.3 Systematic Sampling
**Application**: When population is large and homogeneous

**Procedure**:
1. Calculate sampling interval (N/n)
2. Select random starting point (1 to interval)
3. Select every nth item thereafter
4. Ensure population completeness and accuracy

### 2.2 Judgmental Sampling Framework

#### 2.2.1 Targeted Selection Criteria
- **High-value transactions**: Top 10% by dollar value
- **Unusual transactions**: Outside normal business patterns
- **High-risk periods**: During significant changes or incidents
- **Key personnel**: Transactions processed by critical individuals
- **System boundaries**: Transactions crossing system interfaces

#### 2.2.2 Stratified Sampling Approach
1. **Population Stratification**
   - By dollar value (high, medium, low)
   - By transaction type (routine, non-routine)
   - By processing location (automated, manual)
   - By time period (quarterly distribution)

2. **Sample Allocation**
   - Proportional allocation based on stratum size
   - Optimal allocation based on variability
   - Disproportional allocation based on risk

### 2.3 Population Definition and Completeness

#### 2.3.1 Population Boundaries
- **Temporal Boundaries**: Exact start/end dates for testing period
- **Operational Boundaries**: Specific systems, processes, or locations
- **Functional Boundaries**: Types of transactions or activities
- **Organizational Boundaries**: Business units or legal entities

#### 2.3.2 Population Completeness Testing
1. **Sequence Testing**: Verify completeness of numbered documents
2. **Cut-off Testing**: Ensure proper period boundaries
3. **System Reconciliation**: Tie population to system totals
4. **Management Representation**: Obtain written confirmation
