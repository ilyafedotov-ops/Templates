- **Technical**: Accept medium-risk vulnerabilities with compensating controls

**Risk Treatment Strategies**:
- **Critical/High Risk**: Must be treated immediately with multiple controls
- **Medium Risk**: Requires mitigation within 90 days or compensating controls
- **Low Risk**: Can be accepted with monitoring or transferred via insurance
- **Very Low Risk**: Can be accepted without additional controls
